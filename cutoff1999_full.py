"""Shared December-31-1999 cutoff machinery (regexes + filter prompt).

Same doctrine as HHH-2000/HelpSteer-2000/RedTeam-2000/SysPrompt-2000/
WildChat-2000: a regex hard-drop on years 2000-2099 and unambiguous
post-1999 markers, then an LLM verdict with the motivation rule. Copied
from those environments' cutoff1999.py, except:
  - the stage-2 judge call in filter_data.py uses deepseek-v4.1-flash via
    the internal infer.gr.inc gateway instead of gpt-5-mini via OpenAI
    directly (per explicit instruction for this dataset);
  - SYSTEM_PROMPT additionally asks the judge to name the specific
    disqualifying term(s) on a drop, and `build_terms_regex` lets
    filter_data.py fold newly-named terms the regex missed back into the
    regex mid-run -- stage 2 teaches stage 1, so later records (in the same
    run, and future reruns) that use the same term get caught for free
    instead of costing another LLM call. The base POST_2000_TERMS list and
    the rest of the doctrine are otherwise unchanged.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are curating a conversation dataset for a language model whose knowledge ends on 31 December 1999. Judge whether a conversation is safe for that cutoff.

Answer KEEP only if BOTH hold:
1. Every fact, event, product, technology, person-in-role, work of culture, and cultural reference mentioned anywhere in the conversation existed or had happened by 31 December 1999.
2. The requests themselves would plausibly have been made before the year 2000. Drop conversations that are post-1999-MOTIVATED even when their surface entities existed earlier -- e.g. a question about Joe Biden driven by his later prominence as vice president or president, or any request whose natural occasion is a later event, technology, or cultural moment.

Answer DROP if anything violates either condition, or if the conversation otherwise leaks a post-1999 setting (dates, prices that only make sense later, later norms or slang).

Anticipating the year 2000 as a future event (Y2K preparations, millennium plans) is acceptable. Ignore the framing that this is a conversation with an AI assistant -- that framing is out of scope.

If you answer false, also name the specific post-1999 term(s) or short phrase(s) (as they literally appear in the text) that are the disqualifying evidence -- but ONLY terms that are inherently and unambiguously post-1999 IN ISOLATION, out of context, such that the bare term/phrase could not plausibly appear in an authentic pre-2000 document at all. This means: a specific brand/product/company name, a named event, or a real person's name used specifically in a role or context that only exists after 1999.

Do NOT name: generic English words or phrases (however evocative), general scientific/technical/academic terms or concepts (even ones popularly associated with modern AI -- e.g. "machine learning" and "artificial intelligence" are 1950s terms), programming languages/libraries/keywords that predate 2000 (e.g. "python", "var"), a bare first name or common surname, or anything that is disqualifying only because of the motivation rule or surrounding context rather than the term itself. When in doubt, name fewer terms rather than more -- omit it entirely if any doubt exists. It is fine to answer {"keep": false} with an empty disqualifying_terms list.

Reply with a single JSON object: {"keep": true} or {"keep": false, "reason": "<short reason>", "disqualifying_terms": ["<term>", ...]}."""

Answer NO if the term is a generic English word or phrase, a general scientific/technical/academic concept (even one popularly associated with modern technology), a programming language/library/keyword, a bare first name or common surname, an ordinary place name, or anything whose post-1999-ness depends on context rather than the term itself.
